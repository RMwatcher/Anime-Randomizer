# Anime Newsroom

This website will utilize a public API Jikan API, an unofficial MyAnimeList REST API to display requested results onto the webpage. This particular API improves upon MyAnimeList API which makes it easier for users when they want to use the REST API from MyAnimeList.

## Instructions

Keep in mind that this is ongoing meaning I'll update this README file throughout the project.

To run this project on your local machine, first you need to enter the commands npm i or npm install which both will go the same thing. This will ensure you have the latest dependencies for your build. This next command is optional but this project uses nodemon so be sure to enter npm i nodemon to install nodemon, otherwise you can just use node.

Next, you enter nodemon index.js or node index.js to run the project on your machine. If the project doesn't open right away, open up your browser of choice and enter local:host/3000 on the search bar.

As soon as you press enter, it'll populate the site with a randomly generated anime title. To generate a new title, all you have to do is click on the refresh button towards the top of the page. To learn more about a specific title, you can click on the link directly below the image. It'll take you to the MyAnimeList website which you can learn more about your anime of your choice.

If you have an account with MyAnimeList, you can easily save the anime you're interested in to your list for later. Keep in mind that having an account with MyAnimeList is not required to use this website, but it could keep track of what you want to watch at a later date.

* Please Note
  You can look at the official GitHub page of [Jikan REST API](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan-rest) page as well as the [documentation](https://docs.api.jikan.moe/). Jikan is not affiliated with MyAnimeList.net, myself included. Jikan is a free, open-source API which anyone can use so as long as you use it responsibility.
