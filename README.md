# Anime Newsroom

This website will utilize a public API Jikan API, an unofficial MyAnimeList REST API to display requested results onto the webpage. This particular API improves upon MyAnimeList API which makes it easier for users when they want to use the REST API from MyAnimeList.

* Please Note
  You can look at the official GitHub page of Jikan REST API page as well as documentation.

  ## Instructions

Keep in mind that this is ongoing meaning I'll update this README file throughout the project.

To run this project on your local machine, first you need to enter the commands npm i or npm install which both will go the same thing. This will ensure you have the latest dependencies for your build. This next command is optional but this project uses nodemon so be sure to enter npm i nodemon to install nodemon, otherwise you can just use node.

Next, you enter nodemon index.js or node index.js to run the project on your machine. If the project doesn't open right away, open up your browser of choice and enter local:host/3000 on the search bar.
